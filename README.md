# omaRandomizer
A script that pulls a random beatmap with a specific modset from the osu!matchmaking pools.

## Installation
If you have python installed, then clone the git then install the dependencies, which are:

- requests (not builtin)
- datetime
- json
- time
- random
- collections

Most of these dependencies are already builtin. So all you need to install is the requests module.

    pip install requests

If you don't have python installed, you can just grab the executable file from the releases page

## Usage
Run the program, then pick the minimum and maximum MMR. After that, pick a mapset you would like to play (NM1, HR3, and so on). You can also type INFO to check the remaining beatmaps the program has not picked.
